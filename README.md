# The World Inside Our Home
This project was built as part of our coursework for MSc in Computation and Data Journalism at Cardiff University. It’s a work in progress.

This project offers analysis and visualisations of the symbiotic relationship, born of commodities, between the UK and other countries. We focus on the things we commonly have at home from three industries: food, textile, and wood. Our analysis and visualisations were based on 10-year data, if available and whenever necessary to the analysis. At the time this project was created, the latest available data was as of 2017.

## Navigate this site
Click either of the three main headings “Food,” “Textile,” or “Wood” on the homepage. This will highlight things we commonly have at home from a specific industry.

To see the countries that import these things into the UK on a world map, click the “Explore” link on the right. The world map shows all importing countries in 2017 for the selected industry. The lines on the map are scaled according to either import value in pounds or import volume. On the map, click any country to view a list of the import statistics from that location. Other visualisations are shown along with text.

Go back to “Home” to explore other industries or go to “About” to check the data sources and methodology.

## Data sources

For the food industry, we sourced trade data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the UK food self-sufficiency data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Trade values were converted from dollars to pounds using the average exchange rates and GDP deflator from 2007 to 2017 were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HM Treasury, respectively.

The 249 codes in ISO 3166 are located on the website of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

## Data Processing

The 249 country codes listed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) were used as a reference for the total number of countries and territories. The ISO list includes all countries, dependent territories that are separate from their parent countries, partially recognized states, and uninhabited territories.

## Publication

This project will be published in May 2020. After date of publication, the development of the project will probably be stopped completely.
