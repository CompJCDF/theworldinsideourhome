# The World Inside Our Home
This project was built as part of our coursework for MSc in Computation and Data Journalism at Cardiff University. Itâ€™s a work in progress.

This project offers analysis and visualisations of the symbiotic relationship, born of commodities, between the UK and other countries. We focus on the things we commonly have at home from three industries: food, textile, and wood. Our analysis and visualisations were based on 10-year data, if available and whenever necessary to the analysis. At the time this project was created, the latest available data was as of 2017.
