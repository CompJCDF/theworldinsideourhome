# The World Inside Our Home

This is a project built as part of our coursework for MSc in Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University. It’s a work in progress.

It offers analysis and visualisations of the symbiotic relationship, born of commodities, between the UK and other countries. We focus on the things we commonly have at home from three industries: food, textile, and wood. Our analysis and visualisations were based on 10-year data, if available and whenever necessary to the analysis. At the time this project was created, the latest available data was as of 2017.

## Navigate this site

Click either of the three main headings “Food,” “Textile,” or “Wood” on the homepage. This will highlight things we commonly have at home from a specific industry.

To see the countries that import these things into the UK on a world map, click the “Explore” link on the right. The world map shows all importing countries in 2017 for the selected industry. The lines on the map are scaled according to either import value in pounds or import volume. On the map, click any country to view a list of the import statistics from that location. Other visualisations are shown along with text.

Go back to “Home” to explore other industries or go to “About” to check the data sources and methodology.

## Data sources

For the food industry, we sourced the trade data from the [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM) of the United Nations and the UK food self-sufficiency data from the [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/agriculture-in-the-united-kingdom). The average exchange rates and GDP deflator from 2007 to 2017 were obtained from the [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/timeseries/auss/mret/previous) and [HM Treasury](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/gdp-deflators-at-market-prices-and-money-gdp-march-2020-budget), respectively.

The 249 codes in ISO 3166 are located on the website of the [International Organization for Standardization(ISO)](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html).

## Data processing

Trade values were converted into thousands, whenever applicable, and from dollars to pounds, using the appropriate exchange rate for a given year. Trade values adjusted for inflation in 2017 pounds were used in the analysis of over a 10-year period.
The list of ISO 3166 country codes was used as a reference for the total number of countries and territories because it is comprehensive.
