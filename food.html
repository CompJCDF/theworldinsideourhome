                        <p class="story-paragraphs">GRANDER than any web a spider could accomplish. Humans have spun a complex web of trade routes across the world to share food for hundreds of years. The map to your left illustrates a small part of that web: trade flows from 180 countries and territories into the UK in 2017.</p>

                    <div class="sub-section intro-div">
                        <p class="story-paragraphs">These trade routes carried about 40.8 million tonnes of food and 40 million live animals worth £43.5 billion. This amount is equivalent to the combined six months’ worth of groceries of all British families.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">The UK has imported about half of its food consumption in the last 10 years. Wine, ketchup, sauces, condiments, pastry, chocolate, cheese, bacon and ham, and chicken are its most valuable food imports.</p>

In North Wales, it is called lobscows. It derived its origin from Celtic cooking of using easily attainable ingredients, a hanging cauldron, and an open fire.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">Zoe Jones, Margaret Davis, and Tommy Ray, restaurant owners in the villages of Manorbier, Laugharne, and Tenby in South West Wales, respectively, serve this traditional Welsh food. Although one’s recipe may differ from the other’s, they all agree on one thing: cawl is cooked with Welsh lamb and extended by root vegetables. Leeks, potatoes, carrots, swedes, parsnips, cabbages, and onions find their way into cawl. Herbs like thyme may also be added. Cawl is traditionally served with slices of bread and slivers of cheese to be sprinkled over it.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">Wales is famous for its lamb. But Redvers du Wayne, a retired chef from Laugharne, and Tiffany Edwards, a local of Tenby, told me that Welsh lamb has become expensive. Wayne revealed that his recipe of cawl has been made with lamb from New Zealand for decades. For him, New Zealand lamb is tender and delicious but costs less than Welsh lamb. Some locals, like Edwards, prefer bacon or ham, while others opt for beef.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">Cawl is typically made with the neck, shoulder, shank, or shin of beef or lamb. Jones and Davis use between 1.5 and 2 kg of lamb for about 12–21 servings of cawl. Jones makes four batches of this dish on a good week, while Davis prepares two or three large batches during the summer when tourists flock to her place.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">The UK’s combined average weight of imported sheep and cattle meat from 2007 to 2017—427,364 tonnes—would make around 160 to 213 batches of their recipe for each of the 1.3 million families in Wales.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">For sheep meat import alone, weighing an average of 96,217 tonnes, New Zealand has been the UK’s primary source, supplying 73% of the yearly total; this figure equates to a tenth of New Zealand’s annual production. While for cattle meat import, weighing an average of 331,147 tonnes, Irish beef makes up 61% of the yearly total, constituting almost a quarter of Ireland’s production.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">Not only meat was imported into the UK; in 2017, 9,332 cattle and 23 sheep also travelled the distance to be slaughtered and arrive at British dinner tables. Both figures represent a drop every year in the number of traded animals, from 42,483 cattle in 2009 and 68,708 sheep in 2007. Specifically, for sheep, the number declined by large amounts, from 68,708 in 2007 to 17,710 in 2010, then it plunged to 33 in 2011.</p>

Leeks are known as among the small number of vegetables that can be grown in one’s backyard and on British soil. “Leek and lamb are the main two ingredients,” he reiterated.</p>

Spain and the Netherlands have been its major sources of leeks.</p>

Carrots are a major root crop in the UK, which accounts for 2% of world’s production. Since 2007, the average yearly demand for carrots and turnips from outside the country, mainly from France, Italy, and Israel, has been 46,325 tonnes, valued at more than £1.2 million.</p>

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">Cabbage is not top of mind when Welsh people are asked about cawl’s ingredients, but it appears in some cookbooks, old and new. The UK’s import of cabbages from 2007 to 2017 amounted to an average of £41.6 million or 54,306 tonnes in weight. The Netherlands and Spain are the top exporters, supplying the UK with 8% of each of their annual cabbage production.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Historian Martin Wright from Cardiff University explained, “All nations developed their own range of food based on basically practical concerns.” Traditional food, like cawl, is “a direct result of what was available and easy to harvest.”</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Wales is the peninsula jutting out of western Britain. It is a mass of mountains deeply dissected by rivers. The clear broth of cawl, with cheese served on the side or mixed with oatmeal, mirrors the benevolence of this peninsula: meat and dairy products from hillside pastures, barley and oats from upland farms, and leeks and root vegetables from the fields.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">When I travelled to Wales’s picturesque countryside, I saw hardly a mountain or lush green plain undotted with sheep. The rural uplands, which form the greater part of Wales, can only support livestock farming, especially of the sheep that is suited to the rigours of the climate, Wright confirmed. Sheep farming developed in upland Wales in the late 17th century, particularly during the boom of wool trade. Lamb production has since become the backbone industry of Wales, resulting in cawl, which used to be prepared by Wales’s Celt ancestors with salted bacon, being associated with lamb.</p>
            </div>


             <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Cawl was once a staple food of the rural poor, whose main source of income was hillside and cattle or sheep farming. The dish was made with as minimal cheap cuts of meat as possible, cooked long and slow, and served in stages for economy’s sake; the broth was sipped first, the meat and vegetables pitched in second, and the bread and cheese eaten last, like a three-course meal. Its contents varied with the region and the season.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Today, cawl is taken together and considered comfort food.</p>

                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Long gone are the days of depression period and wartime rationing in the UK that persisted into the 1950s. British people now enjoy a relatively higher disposable income, or the money available for families to be spent or saved after taxes are deducted. Modern affluence in the UK has manifested in consumer abundance. Varieties of fruits and vegetables are no longer a luxury.</p>

                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Food diet in Wales has diversified. In 2018, although meat remains the centrepiece of meals, constituting 22.7% of the weekly food expenditure of £53.5, an average family in Wales also spent on fresh, chilled, and processed fruits and vegetables (17%); bread, rice, and cereals (9.2%); milk and other milk products (7.9%); buns, cakes, and biscuits (6.4%); fish (3.8%); soft drinks and fruit drinks (3.4%); and chocolate (3.4%).</p>

Massive industrial bases in other countries make it possible to get food and other products into the hands of the consumer at a reasonable price.

It is associated with convenience and a spectacular array of products. In 2018, 77.7% of the weekly average food consumed by British families across UK were bought in large supermarket chains, such as Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, and Lidl; 15.7%, from other outlets; and 6.6%, online.</p>

Wholesalers, she says, “get what they can from local places, but [because that’s] not always possible, they go with what are available.” And instead of making her own meat stock, she buys it at a supermarket. For Davis, she gets vegetables at a local supermarket in Carmarthen, a larger town that is a 20-minute drive from Laugharne. Edwards also relies on supermarkets for food ingredients.</p>
